      <description>The second draft of the book is done! Woohoo!
I sent it out to some of my friends. I hope they don’t totally despise it! I’m taking a break from writing for about a month now so that I can come back with fresh eyes and fresh fingies for a-typin’.
Also, I just finished my writing class! Woohoo again! Watch out JRR Tolkien, I’m coming for your crown.
I’ll write an update when the reviews from my friends have come back!</description>

      <title>Outlining vs. Wingin&#39; It</title>

      <description>36,000 words in. Progress is progressing. Some days it flows out of me like lightning from Palpatine&amp;rsquo;s fingers, sometimes it flows like granite embedded in diamond. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s somewhere in between.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to write about something I have very little expertise in — which you can expect from most of my posts going forward. If only I wrote about things I&amp;rsquo;m an expert at, I&amp;rsquo;d write one post every decade.</description>

      <title>Hey Look, a Blog!</title>

      <description>Oh hello there!
Here&amp;rsquo;s a true story for you. My friend once showed me a book and said &amp;ldquo;My buddy published this collection of his own poetry.&amp;rdquo; I thought &amp;ldquo;Pshh, I could write a book, I bet it&amp;rsquo;s not that hard.&amp;rdquo;
Two years later, here I am, fully lacking any published books. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that maybe it&amp;rsquo;s harder to write a novel than I had initially thought. While it takes maybe ten hours to read a book, it turns out it takes a bit longer to actually write one.</description>
