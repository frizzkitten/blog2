[{"content":"Oh hello there!\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a true story for you. My friend once showed me a book and said \u0026ldquo;My buddy published this collection of his own poetry.\u0026rdquo; I thought \u0026ldquo;Pshh, I could write a book, I bet it\u0026rsquo;s not that hard.\u0026rdquo;\nTwo years later, here I am, fully lacking any published books. I\u0026rsquo;ll admit that maybe it\u0026rsquo;s harder to write a novel than I had initially thought. While it takes maybe ten hours to read a book, it turns out it takes a bit longer to actually write one. Who knew?\nAnyway, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty excited about this series. Should I keep it secret that it\u0026rsquo;ll be trilogy? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. I\u0026rsquo;ll update you on that later. For now, let\u0026rsquo;s just keep that between you and me.\nFun fact: I had my friend read through the first couple chapters of the first draft. She told me to stop naming all the characters after my friends. Sorry Kevin and Nick, I guess you don\u0026rsquo;t get namesakes. But it\u0026rsquo;s okay, I probably would have killed them off in the first couple chapters.\nAnyway, I plan to update this site every day or week or year or so. At a minimum, I\u0026rsquo;ll definitely probably update it when I publish a new book.\nSloppy smooches, {Pen Name Not Yet Determined}\n","permalink":"https://www.flynnblair.com/posts/hey-look-a-blog/","summary":"Oh hello there!\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a true story for you.
