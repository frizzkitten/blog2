[{"content":"36,000 words in. Progress is progressing. Some days it flows out of me like lightning from Palpatine\u0026rsquo;s fingers, sometimes it flows like granite embedded in diamond. Usually it\u0026rsquo;s somewhere in between.\nIn this post, I\u0026rsquo;m going to write about something I have very little expertise in — which you can expect from most of my posts going forward. If only I wrote about things I\u0026rsquo;m an expert at, I\u0026rsquo;d write one post every decade.\nThere are two main ways to write a book. The first way is to come up with an outline of a story, then write scenes that follow the outline. The second way is to come up with interesting characters (+ interesting setting = bonus points), then to just start writing and have a plot come about on its own.\nThere are pros and cons to both methods.\nIf you have a great outline, it will be difficult to get stuck, because you always know where you\u0026rsquo;re going. Sure, some transitions between scenes may be awkward, but that\u0026rsquo;s what editing is for. However, interesting characters don\u0026rsquo;t naturally form based on an outline. You may have an exciting set of events, but if the characters enacting the events aren\u0026rsquo;t memorable, it won\u0026rsquo;t be fun to read.\nOn the other hand, if you have a bunch of really great characters with conflicting motivations and just start writing, it\u0026rsquo;s likely something interesting is going to happen. But you may get stuck at some point and have to stare at the screen for a while. You\u0026rsquo;ll probably need to just write some real garbage at that point — try to come up with 5 different ways it could go, and pick the most interesting. Or maybe you need to backtrack a bit, delete your last chapter, try a different set of actions starting a chapter ago.\nBut I can only speculate on that — this is my first book, and I\u0026rsquo;m going the outline route. I\u0026rsquo;ve outlined the vast majority of the scenes in the first book, as well as many of the major events for the second and third books. I\u0026rsquo;m sure a lot of things will change in the second and third books' outlines after I finish the first book, but it was important to me that I knew generally how the saga would end before finishing the first book.\nAnyway, if I write a second series, I\u0026rsquo;d like to try the character-based method. From what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far, the outline method front-loads lots of the frustration of figuring out what should happen, so when I\u0026rsquo;m writing it\u0026rsquo;s usually not exceedingly difficult. Frustration would probably be more spread-out with the character method, but it could also be fun to come to a conclusion that I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect, to be surprised by the events just like a reader would be.\nLove, Flynn\n","permalink":"https://www.flynnblair.com/posts/outlining-vs-wingin-it/","summary":"36,000 words in.

My friend once showed me a book and said \u0026ldquo;My buddy published this collection of his own poetry.\u0026rdquo; I thought \u0026ldquo;Pshh, I could write a book, I bet it\u0026rsquo;s not that hard.\u0026rdquo;\nTwo years later, here I am, fully lacking any published books. I\u0026rsquo;ll admit that maybe it\u0026rsquo;s harder to write a novel than I had initially thought. While it takes maybe ten hours to read a book, it turns out it takes a bit longer to actually write one. Who knew?\nAnyway, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty excited about this series. Should I keep it secret that it\u0026rsquo;ll be trilogy? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. I\u0026rsquo;ll update you on that later. For now, let\u0026rsquo;s just keep that between you and me.\nFun fact: I had my friend read through the first couple chapters of the first draft. She told me to stop naming all the characters after my friends. Sorry Kevin and Nick, I guess you don\u0026rsquo;t get namesakes. But it\u0026rsquo;s okay, I probably would have killed them off in the first couple chapters.\nAnyway, I plan to update this site every day or week or year or so. At a minimum, I\u0026rsquo;ll definitely probably update it when I publish a new book.\nSloppy smooches, Flynn Blair (final name TBD)\n","permalink":"https://www.flynnblair.com/posts/hey-look-a-blog/","summary":"Oh hello there!\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a true story for you.
